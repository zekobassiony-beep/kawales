description: TestSprite verification loop — after finishing a feature or fix in a TestSprite-tested repo, use the `testsprite` CLI to run the relevant TestSprite tests against the change and inspect any failure artifacts before reporting the work as done. Use whenever code has changed outside docs/config and is about to be reported complete — by running an existing test that covers the change, or by creating a new TestSprite test (a frontend plan, or a backend Python assertion) and running it to a terminal verdict.

# TestSprite Verification Loop

The verification loop that flies your just-shipped feature through the
TestSprite CLI and reports back.

You just finished a piece of work in a TestSprite-tested repo. Before you report
it done, **actually run the relevant TestSprite test(s)** through the `testsprite`
CLI and read the result. Spec review and unit tests catch correctness; only
running the test catches what breaks for a real user.

## When to run

Run after a feature or fix lands — one feature → one test run, at the moment it
lands, not batched at the end. Tests you create this way accumulate into the
project's TestSprite suite; before writing a new one, check `testsprite test list`
for an existing test that already covers the behavior and extend it instead of
duplicating.

The CLI tests either a **deployed** URL or a frontend test running on this
machine — it doesn't build or host your environment either way. For a deployed
change, wait until it's live somewhere reachable (e.g. open the PR, let CI
deploy the preview/staging environment). Create a named environment for its
public URL once, then select it with `--env <name>` on runs. Running earlier
verifies the previous build, not your change.

For a change that is only running locally, don't wait for a deployment: run
`testsprite test run <test-id> --local <port>` instead. It tunnels this
machine's own loopback address (`localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `::1` — not a LAN
or RFC1918 address, and not a general local-network escape hatch) to the test
runner. It is for frontend tests only (a backend test's target is baked into
its generated code, so run it normally). Existing API keys work for local runs; no replacement key is
needed. `--local <port>` selects or creates the
project's `local-<port>` environment. With `--env <name> --local <port>`, that
named environment must also be local (`project env list <projectId>` shows names).

If the user explicitly named a tool (the CLI or the MCP), honor that choice
regardless of which one the change's reachability would otherwise suggest.

## When to skip

The skip list is narrow:

- Docs-only edits (`docs/**`, `*.md`, comments).
- Pure build/config edits (`tsconfig*`, lint/prettier config, lockfile bumps with
  no behavior change).
- Credentials are unavailable. Explain the missing setup; do not claim a
  verified result. If credentials exist but a local project is missing, use
  the bootstrap below.

Otherwise, run it.

## The one-test minimum

Every shipped feature gets **at least one** TestSprite run to a terminal verdict
(`passed` / `failed` / `blocked` / `inconclusive`) before you call it done. What
counts:

- `testsprite test create … --run --wait` returning a terminal verdict, **or**
- `testsprite test run <id> --wait` against an existing test, **or**
- `testsprite test create-batch --plans plans.jsonl --run --wait` (or
  two-step: create-batch, then `test run <id> --wait`) on at least one
  test returning a terminal verdict.

What does **not** count: unit tests / typecheck / lint; drafting a plan without
`--run`; asking the user to run it for you.

If the project has **no tests at all**, that's the `testsprite-onboard` skill's
job, not this one — seed a suite first (it can generate the proposals for you
with `testsprite test plan generate` / `test plan accept` for a deployed target;
local projects require authored plans and `test create --plan-from`). Seeding is a deliberate setup pass, not part of the verify loop.

If you can't satisfy this — no creds, no valid target URL, repo not linked —
**say so explicitly**: "Feature shipped but I could not run any TestSprite test
because <X>. Treat this as unverified until that's resolved." Don't claim done.

## 1. Preflight

```bash
testsprite --version              # CLI installed?
testsprite auth status            # credentials configured?
```

- `--version` fails → the CLI isn't installed. Tell the user to install the
  TestSprite CLI (see the TestSprite docs) and stop; don't install it for them.
- `auth status` fails → no credentials. Tell the user they can run
  `testsprite setup`, then stop.

## 2. Find the project

In priority order:

1. `$TESTSPRITE_PROJECT_ID` if set.
2. `.testsprite/config.json` in the repo root, if it has a `projectId`.
3. `testsprite project list --output json` → match a project whose `name` looks
   like this repo (e.g. a `Portal` repo → the `Portal` project).
4. Still ambiguous → list the candidates and ask the user which to use (one short
   question; picking the wrong project wastes a run).

If no project exists for an app running only locally, bootstrap a frontend project
(V3 required), author a plan, and run the returned test id:

```bash
testsprite project create --type frontend --name "<repo name>" --local <port> --local-host <host>
testsprite test create --plan-from plan.json --project <projectId>
testsprite test run <id> <id> --local <port> --local-host <host> --output json
```

Keep the app listening and use the same `--local-host` for creation and follow-up
runs. It selects both the probe and stored URL host: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`
(default), or `::1`; omit it in both commands to use the default.
The port probe fails with exit 5 if nothing listens (`--skip-preflight`
bypasses it). Local projects skip exploration: `test plan generate` is refused
before charge (exit 6), so use `test create --plan-from` without `--run`, then
`test run --local`. V2-only local-project creation is unsupported (exit 7).
The Portal shows local environments without a Run action. Create a public
environment for deployed apps and select it with `--env <name>`.

## 3. Decide what to test

Look at the diff (`git diff --stat`, then the changed files) to understand what
user-facing behavior changed. Pick one sub-mode. For a brand-new feature the
right default is almost always (b) or (c); (a) is for tweaks to behavior an
existing test already covers.

### (a) An existing test covers the change

```bash
testsprite test list --project <projectId> --output json
testsprite test list --project <projectId> --status failed --output json   # what's already red
```

Heuristic: a change to `src/components/CheckoutForm.tsx` is more likely covered
by "Checkout happy path" than "Login flow." Frontend change → `type: frontend`;
backend → `type: backend`.

### (b) A new test for the change (most common)

**Frontend — draft a `plan.json`.** You name the behavior and list steps in plain
language; you don't write browser code.

```jsonc
{
  "projectId": "prj_abc",
  "type": "frontend",
  "name": "Booking date range change updates the estimated total",
  "description": "When a user opens a listing and extends the booking date range, the booking-panel estimated total updates to reflect the new dates before payment.",
  "priority": "p1",
  "planSteps": [
    { "type": "action", "description": "Navigate to the homepage" },
    { "type": "action", "description": "Search for stays with a valid destination and date range" },
    { "type": "action", "description": "Open a listing from the search results" },
    {
      "type": "action",
      "description": "Select an initial short date range to view the estimated total",
    },
    { "type": "action", "description": "Change the date range to a longer stay" },
    {
      "type": "assertion",
      "description": "Verify the estimated total on the booking panel updates from the initial value to reflect the new longer dates",
    },
  ],
}
```

- `name` — an assertable behavior statement (subject + verb + outcome), not a noun
  fragment — e.g. "Booking date range change updates the estimated total" tells
  the testing agent what to verify; "date range" tells it nothing.
- `description` — the condition + expected outcome in one sentence; disambiguates
  a short name.
- `priority` — `p0` (must-pass) / `p1` (important paths) / `p2` (edge) / `p3`
  (cosmetic). Pick honestly.
- `planSteps` — `Array<{ type: 'action' | 'assertion', description: string }>`,
  max 200 steps / 256 KB. Describe user intent, not selectors.

**Backend — write the Python yourself and use `--code-file`.** There is no
server-side codegen on the CLI. Read the API surface that changed (OpenAPI, the
route handler, request/response shapes) and write a pytest-style assertion script
to a tempfile. **End the file by calling your `test_*` function(s)** — the runner
executes the file top-to-bottom and does NOT auto-discover/collect test functions
the way `pytest` does, so a test that is only _defined_ (never called) silently
passes regardless of its assertions:

```python
# /tmp/login-empty-password.py — runs against the project's target URL, creds injected.
import requests

def test_login_rejects_empty_password():
    r = requests.post(f"{TARGET_URL}/login", json={"email": "a@b.c", "password": ""})
    assert r.status_code == 400
    assert r.json().get("error") == "invalid password"

# Required: actually invoke the test so its assertions run.
test_login_rejects_empty_password()
```

**Execution environment (backend).** The code runs in a locked-down sandbox with
only the Python **standard library + `requests` + `pytest` + `numpy` + `scipy`**
(plus `requests`' own deps like `urllib3`). So:

- **Test the API over HTTP** with `requests` against the target URL — that's what a
  backend test verifies.
- **Do NOT `import` the project's own source modules** (e.g. `from app.services import …`,
  `import core`, `import model`) or other third-party/ML packages (e.g. `torch`,
  `pandas`, `django`). They are not installed, so the test fails to even run.
- Get values from the API's responses (and captured variables), not by importing and
  calling the app's internals.

**Authentication — read the injected credential, NEVER hardcode any credential.** This
applies to **every** secret the API needs — Bearer/JWT tokens **and** API keys, basic-auth
blobs, session cookies. Do not paste a literal `Bearer …`, `sk-…`, `x-api-key` value, or any
other credential into the test. Before your script runs, TestSprite prepends a managed
credential block built from the project's Authentication settings, and `__AUTH_HEADERS__`
already contains the right header(s) for the configured auth type:

```python
# Auto-injected credentials — do not modify
__AUTH_CREDENTIAL__ = "..."
__AUTH_TYPE__       = "Bearer token"            # or "API key" / "basic token" / "public"
__AUTH_HEADERS__    = {"Authorization": "Bearer ..."}   # API key → {"X-API-Key": "..."}; basic → {"Authorization": "Basic ..."}
```

Spread `__AUTH_HEADERS__` into every authenticated request — it adapts to whatever auth type
the project is configured for, so the same line works for Bearer, API-key, or basic auth:

```python
r = requests.get(f"{TARGET_URL}/profile", headers={**__AUTH_HEADERS__})
```

Configure the credential **once on the project** (ask the user for the value — never invent
or reuse a key you happened to see), and the block stays correct + refreshable:

- **Bearer / API key / basic (static):**
  `testsprite project credential <projectId> --type "Bearer token"|"API key"|"basic token" --credential <value>`
- **Auto-refreshing login (recurring token):** `testsprite project auto-auth <projectId> …`

A hardcoded token expires within hours (and a hardcoded key can't be rotated centrally), so
the test breaks on later runs; the managed block is rewritten with a fresh value each run.
`test create` emits a `[warn]` when it detects an inlined credential literal — treat that as
a must-fix, not a nuisance.

**Backend tests that share state declare dependencies at create time.** For a
one-off verification, prefer a single self-contained script (log in inside the
same file). But when the coverage set splits naturally into producer → consumer
→ cleanup — one test captures an auth token or created-resource id that others
reuse — declare the graph with the dependency flags instead of duplicating setup
in every file:

```bash
# producer — captures a variable for later waves
testsprite test create --type backend --project <projectId> --name "login issues an auth token" \
  --code-file /tmp/login.py --produces auth_token

# consumer — scheduled in a wave after every producer it names
testsprite test create --type backend --project <projectId> --name "profile update accepts the issued token" \
  --code-file /tmp/profile.py --needs auth_token

# cleanup — always scheduled in the final wave
testsprite test create --type backend --project <projectId> --name "fixture user is deleted" \
  --code-file /tmp/cleanup.py --category teardown
```

- `--produces <var>` / `--needs <var>` are repeatable. All three flags are
  **backend-only** — combined with `--type frontend` the CLI exits 5.
- **Don't hand-sequence `test run` calls to fake ordering.** The wave engine owns
  ordering: trigger the set with `test run --all` (§4) and producers run before
  consumers, `teardown` last. Chaining `run A --wait && run B --wait` yourself
  loses the engine's variable passing and conflicts with concurrent runs.
- **Declarations are editable.** `test update` amends them (`--produces` /
  `--needs` / `--category`, repeatable) and `test get` echoes them back —
  still declare the graph at create time when you can, so wave ordering is
  right on the first run.

**Show the user the drafted plan / code before creating it** — creating writes to
their project. One short confirmation; let them edit the tempfile first.

#### Authoring planSteps the testing agent will execute reliably

Execution reliability tracks plan wording. A loose plan produces a
confidently-wrong `passed` (bare visibility assertions) or a thrashing
`blocked`. Write to these rules first:

- **One verb per step.** `and` / `then` between two verbs → split — e.g.
  "Search for stays and open the first result" becomes two steps.
- **Describe outcomes, not selectors.** The testing agent locates targets
  semantically — describe the intent and the match stays robust across copy
  changes; a guessed literal label defeats that. E.g. write `"Submit the form"`,
  not `"Click the blue 'Submit' button"`. If the app tags elements with its own
  attribute (`data-element`, `data-cy`, …), make sure the project knows —
  `testsprite project get <projectId>` shows `testIdAttrs:`; set it once with
  `project update <projectId> --test-id-attributes <attr>,data-testid` — and the
  exported code will locate tagged elements by that attribute instead of text.
- **`Navigate to` only on step 1** (or a login page). Use clicks for every later
  transition — direct URLs break SPA routing.
- **FE plans narrate a user journey through their actions.** Each action is
  what a real user does (click, type, navigate, hover, scroll), forming a
  sequence that exercises what gives the feature its value. The final assertion
  verifies what the journey produced — the state the user arrived at, a
  comparison against an earlier state, a derived count — not just that the
  starting page rendered.
- **Name the target entity type, not a fuzzy noun.** If a page has several
  look-alike row kinds, "open a thing" lets the testing agent pick the wrong
  kind. Name the type and the page/view you expect to land on.
- **1–2 assertions, at the end, on whether the content is present _and actually
  works_** (see _presence ≠ working_ below) rather than UI copy / formatting.
  (Quoting a literal you submitted earlier in the same plan, to verify it
  round-trips, is fine.)
- **Presence ≠ working.** A node can exist yet be broken or wrong — e.g. an
  `<img>` whose `src` 404s renders a broken-image box but still passes "element
  present / has alt." Assert the thing actually **works and is correct**, not
  just that the tag exists; trust the testing agent to judge correctness rather
  than hard-coding the expected answer into the assertion.
- **Assertion targets name the specific page region** (panel / tab / output area).
  Otherwise the testing agent settles for "some element with that text is
  visible anywhere," which passes for wrong reasons.
- **For visual / CSS / layout-sensitive features, content-presence-only
  assertions are dangerous.** "Verify the methodology section is visible" passes
  even when the stylesheet is missing and three cards render as flat unstyled
  text stacked vertically — the strings exist on the page, and a content-presence
  assertion constrains nothing about layout. For any feature whose value depends on
  layout, include at least one assertion that names geometry or relative
  position (row, column, side-by-side, stacked, grid, above/below, span, card
  background, border), not just content existence:

  ```jsonc
  // BEFORE — content-presence-only (passes even on broken CSS)
  { "type": "assertion", "description": "Verify the methodology section with three sub-score formulas is visible" }

  // AFTER — content + layout
  { "type": "assertion", "description": "Verify the methodology section shows three card cells laid out side-by-side in a single horizontal row, each with a distinct card background and a heading; the three cards together span the full content width" }
  ```

- **Keep `description` and `planSteps` in scope agreement** — the testing agent
  reads `description` as the test's purpose and shrinks execution to match. If
  you change the steps, re-align the description.
- **Keep flows that depend on state outside the test's control out of scope:**
  third-party auth (OAuth/SSO/2FA), OS-native surfaces (file upload/download,
  drag-and-drop, native dialogs), cross-context state (iframes, multi-tab,
  external services). Pick a different verification.
- **Test data must be self-contained** — create what you need within the plan, or
  don't write the plan.

### (c) A coverage set — multiple FE plans as a batch

When a FE feature has distinct paths (happy + error + edge), draft a
`plans.jsonl`, one spec per line. Aim for 2–5 plans; more only with explicit user
confirmation. Max 50 plans / 5 MB per batch.

```jsonc
// plans.jsonl — FE only
{"projectId":"prj_abc","type":"frontend","name":"login happy path","planSteps":[...]}
{"projectId":"prj_abc","type":"frontend","name":"login wrong password","planSteps":[...]}
{"projectId":"prj_abc","type":"frontend","name":"login empty email","planSteps":[...]}
```

Batch is **FE-only.** For 3 backend tests, run `test create --type backend
--project <projectId> --code-file <file>` three times with three Python files.

### (d) Refine an existing test

- **FE** — replace the steps, then re-run:
  ```bash
  testsprite test plan put <test-id> --steps refined.json
  ```
- **BE** — write updated Python and replace the code (optimistic concurrency):
  ```bash
  testsprite test code put <test-id> --code-file refined.py --expected-version <current-version>
  ```

## 4. Run

For a deployed target, create its environment once, then use `--env <name>`
after that deployment contains the change. Omit `--env` for Default; an unknown
name fails with available names and never falls back. For a local change,
use `testsprite test run <test-id> --local <port>` (frontend only); it implies
waiting and defaults to 1200 seconds. Create a missing test from a plan first,
without `--run`, then run its id with `--local`.

```bash
# One-time setup for a deployed target
testsprite project env create <projectId> --name staging --url https://staging.example.com

# (a) existing test
testsprite test run <test-id> --env staging --wait --timeout 600 --output json

# (a-rerun) replay of a deployed test (V3 FE: 0.5 credit). Replays saved code (auto-heal on — more
# lenient than a fresh run; for strict verification of a new change prefer `test run`).
# BE: dispatches the WHOLE dependency closure — producers and teardowns run too, not just <test-id>,
# so expect their side effects (fixtures re-created, teardown deletes) and extra runs in history.
testsprite test rerun <test-id> --env staging --wait --timeout 600 --output json
testsprite test rerun <test-id> --skip-dependencies --wait --timeout 600   # BE: named test only

# (b-FE) new FE test from plan
testsprite test create --plan-from plan.json --run --wait --env staging --timeout 600

# (b-BE) new BE test from Python (backend create needs --project)
testsprite test create --type backend --name "..." --project <projectId> --code-file foo.py --run --wait --timeout 600

# (b-BE coverage set with dependencies) create each test without --run, then one wave-ordered batch
testsprite test run --all --project <projectId> --env staging --wait --timeout 600 --output json
testsprite test run --all --project <projectId> --filter <name-substr> --wait --timeout 600   # subset by name

# (c) FE coverage set — single-call create + run (FE-only)
testsprite test create-batch --plans plans.jsonl --run --wait \
  --env staging --max-concurrency 3 --timeout 600 --output json
# Two-step alternative (inspect before running):
#   testsprite test create-batch --plans plans.jsonl --output json
#   then trigger each id: testsprite test run <test-id> --env staging --wait --timeout 600

# (d-FE) refine + re-run
testsprite test plan put <test-id> --steps refined.json && \
testsprite test run <test-id> --env staging --wait --timeout 600

# (d-BE) refine BE code + re-run. NOTE: if you reach for `test rerun` here instead, a BE rerun
# dispatches the full producer/teardown closure — use --skip-dependencies while iterating on one
# script (producers already verified this round), then finish with a closure run before reporting.
testsprite test code put <test-id> --code-file refined.py --expected-version <current-version> && \
testsprite test run <test-id> --env staging --wait --timeout 600
```

Key behaviors:

- Environment `--url` must be public; the CLI rejects localhost, RFC1918 and
  link-local addresses. For an app on this machine, use `--local <port>`
  (frontend only). If the CLI can list the project's environments, a named
  public environment plus `--local` fails before a tunnel opens; otherwise the
  server refuses the same combination before dispatch. A local environment
  without `--local` is refused before dispatch and costs nothing.
- `--wait` long-polls until terminal and handles its own backoff — don't wrap it
  in a retry loop.
- `--local` implies `--wait`, with a default timeout of 1200 seconds per run (ordinary
  waits default to 600). Run several local frontend tests in ONE command (`test run <id> <id> … --local <port>`) instead of starting one process per test. `--all --project <id> --local <port>` runs frontend tests and reports backend tests as skipped. One tunnel serves the invocation; `--max-concurrency` defaults to 5 and caps at 10. There are
  5 live tunnel bindings per user; `tunnel_binding_limit` is exit 11 and is not
  auto-retried. Reuse a live tunnel with `--tunnel-client` or stop an unused one.
  On a tunnel-limit error, run `testsprite tunnel list`, then `testsprite tunnel stop <id>`
  or `testsprite tunnel stop --all --confirm` if every binding should be revoked.
- Keep the early **stderr** run-id receipts (`Run <runId>` for one test, `[i/N] <testId> → run <runId>` for a batch); `Dashboard: <url>` follows when supplied. Preserve each id even if
  the wait later stops; stdout remains the normal JSON result channel.
- An **owned** local run requests cancellation by default when waiting stops (timeout,
  Ctrl-C, or a polling failure), then its tunnel closes. Read the reported
  cancellation outcome. For a V3 frontend run cancelled before a terminal verdict,
  the backend attempts a refund. Inspect `refund.status`; cancellation does not
  guarantee a refund.
  `--no-cancel-on-interrupt` detaches instead, but the owned tunnel still closes.
  An adopted run normally detaches without cancellation and never closes the
  owner's tunnel. If the CLI confirms the owner has disappeared while the run is
  active, it requests cancellation by default; `--no-cancel-on-interrupt` skips
  that request.
  A second `tunnel start` or process using the same credential takes over, and the first exits **10**.
- Exit codes: `0` = passed; `1` = failed / blocked / cancelled; `7` = timeout
  or unsupported. An owned local timeout is inconclusive: start a **new**
  `testsprite test run <test-id> --local <port> --timeout 1800`, keeping the same
  `--local-host <host>` if used; do not suggest `test wait` for that closed tunnel. Resume **ordinary or adopted-tunnel**
  waits with `testsprite test wait <run-id>` only while the target is reachable
  (and the adopted tunnel's owner remains alive).
- Exit `13` (`FEATURE_GATED`) and exit `12` (`INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS`) are not retriable: show the user the server's message and the link from `nextAction` or JSON `links`, then stop.
- A local environment has a loopback URL and needs `--local <port>` from that
  machine. A bare CLI run selecting it, explicitly or as Default, is refused
  before dispatch without charge (`tunnel-required`, exit 6). The Portal shows
  local environments but offers no Run; backend Portal requests are refused
  without charge. Schedules and test lists targeting them get a free BLOCKED
  result. A deployed environment selected with `--env <name>` or made Default
  runs normally even if the test ran through a tunnel before. V3 local runs use
  the agent path, never saved-code replay, and preserve the test's saved code.
- Batch: `create-batch --run --wait` creates the tests (FE-only) and fans
  out triggers in one call (bounded by `--max-concurrency`), emitting
  `{ results: [...] }` that mirrors the single-test `test run --wait`
  envelope. Exit `0` if every run passed; `1` for any failed/blocked/
  cancelled or trigger error; `7` only when EVERY run timed out. Drop
  `--run` if you want to inspect the created tests before triggering.
- Run-trigger rate limit is 60/min/key, server-enforced; the CLI self-throttles
  to 50/min. `--max-concurrency` (default 50) does NOT raise the server cap —
  excess triggers return `RATE_LIMITED` (per-spec in batch JSON; exit 11 for
  single `test run`). The test row stays created, the run never started. A full
  `create-batch` (≤50 specs) fires all at once under the cap. The 50/min throttle
  is per-invocation — separate batches/processes don't share it — so for >50 specs
  in a minute you lean on the server's 60/min cap + `RATE_LIMITED` retries, not
  client queuing. Re-list and check `draft` rows — "tests created" is
  not the same as "runs triggered".
- **Backend execution is dependency-aware; frontend is not.** `test run --all
--project <id>` triggers a fresh wave-ordered batch over the project's backend
  tests (producers → consumers → `teardown` last); FE tests in the project are
  skipped with an advisory, and everything not dispatched is enumerated
  (`conflicts` / `deferred` / `skippedFrontend`) so don't count `accepted[]`
  alone. `test rerun <be-id>` expands the producer/teardown closure by default —
  stderr summarizes `Reran N tests: 1 selected + P producer(s) + T teardown(s)`,
  and failed members surface as `closureFailures[]` without flipping the exit
  code. Pass `--skip-dependencies` only when this round already verified the
  producers and you're iterating fast on one script.
- `test code put` needs `--expected-version <codeVersion>`; stale etag → exit 6,
  re-fetch via `test get <id>` and retry. `--force` bypasses but is audit-logged.
- Idempotency: the CLI auto-mints an `Idempotency-Key`; replays within 24h return
  the original test/run.

## 4a. Read the result — plan, or product?

Don't take the verdict at face value. After a run, pull the steps
(`testsprite test steps <test-id> --output json`) and ask: **plan quality, or
actual product behavior?**

The plan is the problem (most common — check first) when:

- recorded action count < plan action count → steps the plan left ambiguous were
  skipped;
- assertions degraded to bare "Verify element is visible" with no subject;
- 5+ consecutive click attempts on similar targets with no progress.

The product/environment is the problem (believe these) when:

- `cause` / `error` names a concrete app observation ("the panel renders
  read-only", "page 404s");
- the trace blames infra (deploy lag, auth gate, missing fixture).

`test steps <test-id>` shows the **latest run's steps**. For the run you are
verifying, use `testsprite test steps <test-id> --run-id <run-id> --output json`
with the id from the early stderr receipt. An empty latest run is not evidence
from an earlier run; use `test result <test-id> --history` to choose one explicitly.
Older backends may return cumulative bare steps; pin `--run-id` before counting.

**Read the testing agent's failure summary skeptically — it can conflate two
failure phases.** When a flow produces an artifact that then runs against an external
target, "the backend returned an error" may mean the action endpoint itself
failed (feature broken) **or** the action succeeded and the produced artifact
failed later at runtime (orthogonal to your feature). Cross-check the step trace
and runtime output: if the runtime output references a literal you submitted
earlier in the plan, the action succeeded and the error is runtime-phase.

**BE closure runs: root-cause the earliest failed wave, not the selected test.**
When a rerun or `run --all` expanded a dependency closure and a **producer**
failed, every consumer downstream of it fails or blocks by starvation (missing
token / missing fixture). The selected test's red verdict does not implicate
your feature — report it as failed-downstream, pull the producer's artifact
first, and only blame the consumer once its producers pass in the same run.

If it's the plan: tighten via `test plan put` and re-run **once** (two runs total),
then stop. Don't grind. If it's the product/env: report the verdict with the
testing agent's observation; don't auto-fix on the recommendation alone. If you
genuinely can't tell: report `inconclusive` with the signal that triggered the
call and ask.

## 5. On failure → download the artifact

```bash
testsprite test artifact get <run-id> --out ./.testsprite/runs/<run-id>/
```

Inspect the failure bundle (result, failed step + neighbors, video, root-cause
hypothesis, recommended fix target) before deciding whether your change caused it.

## 6. Report

When you tell the user the feature is done, include:

- Which test(s) you ran — one line each: id, name, verdict. At least one terminal
  verdict is required; zero means the feature is **not** done — surface that.
- The verdict. Don't report `passed` if §4a's sanity check tripped — surface as
  `inconclusive` with the specific signal.
- If the user wants to inspect a test or run themselves, point them at the
  dashboard link from the CLI output (`dashboardUrl` in JSON; a `Dashboard:` line
  in text mode) — `test create` and `--wait` terminal output carry one.
- If failed, a one-line summary of the bundle's root-cause hypothesis and
  recommended fix target. **Don't auto-fix** on that alone — the recommendation
  can be wrong; the human should look.
